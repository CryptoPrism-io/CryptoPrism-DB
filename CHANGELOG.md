# CryptoPrism-DB Changelog

All notable changes to the CryptoPrism-DB project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Version Numbering
- **Major (x.0.0)**: Breaking changes, architecture modifications, database schema changes
- **Minor (x.y.0)**: New features, file reorganization, workflow additions, non-breaking enhancements  
- **Patch (x.y.z)**: Bug fixes, documentation updates, minor configuration tweaks

## [v1.6.0] - 2025-09-07 19:40 UTC

### üîí Security
- **CRITICAL: Removed exposed credentials from repository**:
  - Secured database passwords, API keys, and Telegram tokens that were visible on GitHub main branch
  - Added comprehensive `.gitignore` to protect `.env` files and Claude Code configurations
  - Removed `.claude/` directory and settings from version control
  - Enhanced repository security with protection for temporary files, logs, and build artifacts

### ‚ö° Performance & Optimization  
- **Database Operation Optimization**:
  - **Replaced `if_exists='replace'` with TRUNCATE + INSERT pattern** in all 7 technical analysis scripts
  - **Preserves table structure, primary keys, and indexes** during data refresh operations
  - **Maintains query performance** by avoiding table recreation overhead
  - **Scripts modified**: `gcp_dmv_core.py`, `gcp_dmv_met.py`, `gcp_dmv_osc.py`, `gcp_dmv_mom.py`, `gcp_dmv_rat.py`, `gcp_dmv_pct.py`, `gcp_dmv_tvv.py`
  - Added `from sqlalchemy import text` imports for TRUNCATE operations
  - Created backup copies of all scripts before modification

### ‚úÖ Quality Assurance
- **Streamlined QA Script**: Rewrote `prod_qa_dbcp.py` from 496 to 207 lines (70% reduction)
  - Combined duplicate cleanup + analysis into single-pass operation
  - Simplified AI evaluation logic for consistent results
  - Removed file dependencies - direct memory processing
  - Enhanced error handling and reliability

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements
- **Database Pattern**: `TRUNCATE TABLE "TABLE_NAME"` + `to_sql(..., if_exists='append')` 
- **Backward Compatibility**: Function signatures remain unchanged - existing workflows unaffected
- **Multi-Database Support**: Changes work with both `dbcp` (production) and `cp_backtest` databases
- **Risk Mitigation**: Complete backups stored in `gcp_postgres_sandbox/technical_analysis/backups/`

### üìã Rationale
**Security**: Immediate remediation of exposed credentials preventing potential database compromise or API abuse.

**Performance**: TRUNCATE operations are significantly faster than DROP/CREATE table cycles, especially for large datasets with indexes and constraints. This change eliminates database optimization overhead while maintaining data refresh functionality.

**Reliability**: Simplified QA logic reduces AI evaluation inconsistencies and improves production monitoring accuracy.
