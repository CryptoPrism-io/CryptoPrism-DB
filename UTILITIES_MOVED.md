# Database Utilities Moved

## 🚀 Database Utilities Extracted to Separate Repository

The CryptoPrism database utilities have been organized and moved to a dedicated repository for better maintainability and distribution.

### New Location
**Repository**: `CryptoPrism-DB-Utils` 
**Local Path**: `C:\cp_io_db\CryptoPrism-DB-Utils\`

### What Was Moved
- **26 Python utilities**: Schema analysis, benchmarking, optimization tools
- **2 R integration scripts**: Database connectivity and testing
- **Historical analysis results**: Previous schema analysis and ERD diagrams  
- **SQL optimization scripts**: Generated database optimization SQL
- **Performance benchmarks**: Speed test results and comparisons

### Utilities Organized Into
- **Analysis Tools**: Schema inspection, visualization, column analysis
- **Benchmarking Tools**: Query performance testing, speed analysis
- **Optimization Tools**: Database optimization, index building
- **Indexing Tools**: Strategic index management, primary key tools
- **Validation Tools**: Data integrity, schema validation

### Using the Utilities
```bash
# Navigate to utilities repository
cd C:\cp_io_db\CryptoPrism-DB-Utils

# Install and use via CLI
pip install -e .
cryptoprism-db --help

# Or use directly with Python API
python -c "from crypto_db_utils import DatabaseConnection; print('Available')"
```

### Repository Focus
This repository now focuses exclusively on:
- **Production database management**
- **Technical analysis pipelines** 
- **Data ingestion and processing**
- **Quality assurance and monitoring**
- **CI/CD workflows for production data**

### Benefits of Separation
- **Cleaner codebase**: Production scripts separated from analysis tools
- **Independent development**: Utilities can evolve independently
- **Better distribution**: Utilities packaged for pip installation
- **Focused repository**: Each repo has clear, distinct purpose
