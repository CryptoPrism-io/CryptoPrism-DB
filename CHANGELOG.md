## [4.2.2] - 2025-01-27 15:45:00 UTC

### Changed
- **Duplicate Prevention Optimization**: Implemented timestamp-based duplicate filtering in `gcp_108k_1kcoins.R`
  - Replaced complex per-table duplicate checking with efficient timestamp-based approach
  - Added comprehensive duplicate detection across all OHLCV tables (main db and backtest db)
  - Optimized SQL queries to check for existing timestamps before inserting new data
  - **Rationale**: User feedback highlighted more efficient approach - check fetched timestamps against existing data rather than complex primary key constraint handling

### Added
- **Backup Script Creation**: Created `gcp_108k_1kcoins_timestamp_optimized.R` for future reference
  - Preserved optimized version of R script with timestamp-based duplicate prevention
  - Maintains development history and provides fallback option
  - **Rationale**: User requested backup copy of optimized changes for future reference and version control

### Technical Details
- **Multi-table Timestamp Checking**: Enhanced duplicate prevention logic
  ```r
  # Get unique timestamps from fetched data and query all target tables
  unique_timestamps <- unique(all_coins$timestamp)
  timestamp_list <- paste0("'", unique_timestamps, "'", collapse = ",")

  # Check across all databases and tables for existing records
  existing_108k <- dbGetQuery(con, paste0("SELECT slug, timestamp FROM \"108_1K_coins_ohlcv\" WHERE timestamp IN (", timestamp_list, ")"))
  existing_1k_main <- dbGetQuery(con, paste0("SELECT slug, timestamp FROM \"1K_coins_ohlcv\" WHERE timestamp IN (", timestamp_list, ")"))
  existing_1k_bt <- dbGetQuery(con_bt, paste0("SELECT slug, timestamp FROM \"1K_coins_ohlcv\" WHERE timestamp IN (", timestamp_list, ")"))
  ```
- **Clean Data Filtering**: Implemented composite key filtering to remove duplicate records before insertion
- **Performance Improvement**: Reduced database operations by pre-filtering data rather than handling constraint violations

**Commit Hash**: `2fd6576`

## [4.2.1] - 2025-01-27 14:30:00 UTC

### Fixed
- **R Script Dependencies**: Resolved missing R package errors in `gcp_108k_1kcoins.R`
  - Added `crypto2` and `dplyr` packages to `requirements.R`
  - Fixed path detection error by replacing `sys.frame(1)$ofile` with `getwd()` approach
  - **Rationale**: Essential packages were missing from dependency list, causing script failures

### Changed
- **PostgreSQL Table Name Handling**: Fixed SQL syntax for numeric-prefixed table names
  - Added double quotes around table names starting with numbers (e.g., `"108_1K_coins_ohlcv"`)
  - Ensured proper PostgreSQL compliance for all database operations
  - **Rationale**: Numeric table prefixes require quoted identifiers in PostgreSQL

### Added
- **Environment Configuration Recovery**: Restored `.env` file from backup location
  - Located and copied environment variables from `CryptoPrism-DB-Utils` directory
  - Verified database credentials and API keys for production environment
  - **Rationale**: Critical configuration file was missing, blocking all database operations
